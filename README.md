# RusTub

**RusTub** is a learning-oriented database engine written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), inspired by [CMU's 15-445/645 Database Systems](https://15445.courses.cs.cmu.edu/) and [BusTub](https://github.com/cmu-db/bustub). This project aims to demystify the internals of modern database systems through hands-on implementation.
